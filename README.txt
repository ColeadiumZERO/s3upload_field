This extension is a variation of the 'Amazon S3 File Upload Field' extension by 
Michael Eichelsdoerfer.

[Installation]

1. Upload the 's3upload_field' folder in this archive to your Symphony 
   'extensions' folder.

2. Enable it by selecting the "Field: Amazon S3 Upload", choose Enable from 
   the with-selected menu, then click Apply.

3. You can now add the "Amazon S3 File Upload" field to your sections.

[UPDATING]

There is no special update procedure for this extension if you are using 
(or updating to) Symphony 2.0.6. 

(There has been a manual update procedure for all upload fields in earlier 
Symphony versions which has been moved to the Symphony updater script.)
