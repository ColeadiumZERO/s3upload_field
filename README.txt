[Origin]

This extension is a variation of the 'Amazon S3 File Upload Field' extension by 
Michael Eichelsdoerfer and the Akismet extension (for System Preferences) by 
Alistair Kerney. It uses the Amazon S3 PHP class written by Donovan Schonknecht, http://undesigned.org.za/2007/10/22/amazon-s3-php-class.

[Installation]

1. Upload the 's3upload_field' folder in this archive to your Symphony 
   'extensions' folder.

2. Enable it by selecting the "Field: Amazon S3 Upload", choose Enable from 
   the with-selected menu, then click Apply.

3. You can now add the "Amazon S3 File Upload" field to your sections.

[NOTE]


[UPDATING]

There is no special update procedure for this extension if you are using 
(or updating to) Symphony 2.0.6. 

(There has been a manual update procedure for all upload fields in earlier 
Symphony versions which has been moved to the Symphony updater script.)
